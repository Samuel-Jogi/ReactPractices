Here I started practicing React and React Hooks
1. I started from React basics and recollecting all the info about basics
2. Types of passing the props 
3. Types of conditional Rendering

And Hooks also started
The hooks are 
1. UseState()
2. UseEffect()
3. UseReducer()

setItem([...items, newItem])
newItem is the one which is new in the array.
